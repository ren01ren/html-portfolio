<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Rensheen S. Cruz but you can call me Ren. I love playing video games especially Role playing games, I love watching movies
as well. I recently got into working out and I go to the gym three times a week, I also play basketball every weekends. Web developing
catched my attention that's why I started learning it. Hopefully I can succeed and make a career out of Web developing in the future.</p>
